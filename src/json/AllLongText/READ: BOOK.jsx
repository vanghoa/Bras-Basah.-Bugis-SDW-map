            <p>
                As physical books continue to matter less and less in our
                everyday, what are we losing? Are we less aware of things,
                textures and space? Do we become oblivious to light hues and
                tonalities? Are we unable to keep our hands in a fixed position
                for long periods of time, of which it is not tedium that defines
                the duration but the gentle interaction with a book’s physical
                materiality….

                In today's era of artificial intelligence, we find ourselves
                once again questioning our own humanity. Amidst this
                uncertainty, Atelier HOKO has chosen the book as both subject
                and context to explore and interrogate the intrinsic human
                behaviours associated with reading. It raises the discussion of
                how the humble book will continue to resist the digitisation of
                our reading experience, not out of nostalgia or resistance to
                change, but as a necessity to understand what reading truly
                means.

                In the 16th edition of Atelier HOKO’s research publication
                series “Science of the Secondary”, the subject of “BOOK” will be
                thoroughly interrogated through a sense-based process of
                inquiry. This exhibition choreographs a first person experience
                of observations through the context of reading, exploring the
                intimacy and relationships between human beings and books.
