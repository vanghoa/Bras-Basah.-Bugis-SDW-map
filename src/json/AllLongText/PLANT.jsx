                The rise of decorative indoor planting has been phenomenal since
                COVID. Yet, the progress of pots and planters design has largely
                remained stylistic, with the occasional technical novelty.

                In this exhibition, industrial design students negotiate with
                the physical, philosophical, biological, behavioural, and
                ideological relationship between people and (house) plants.

                What if a planter is not a pot? What if a planter is soft? What
                if a planter is obsessive? What if a planter is a sanctuary?
            </p>
            <p>
                Questions as such are teased into design propositions that
                reimagine the common household planter that challenge
                presumptions and provoke new sensibilities.
