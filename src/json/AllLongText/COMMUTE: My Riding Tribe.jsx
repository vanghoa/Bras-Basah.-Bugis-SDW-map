                "My Riding Tribe" offers an interactive experience at Bencoolen
                Station located within the Bras Basah Bugis district.This unique
                project brings to life the diverse personalities of Singapore's
                MRT commuters through both physical and digital installations.
                Commuters can take a personality quiz to discover which
                whimsical "tribe" they belong to, making the daily ride more
                engaging and relatable. The installation features interactive
                displays, augmented reality (AR) animations, and both in-station
                and online quizzes. Designed to enhance awareness and celebrate
                everyday commuting behaviors, "My Riding Tribe" captures the
                essence of shared routines and turns them into fun and
                informative experiences. Join us at Bencoolen Station to explore
                the characters that represent the heartbeat of Singapore's MRT
                system.
