                The exhibition focuses on the experimental approach of Studio
                Juju exploring the idea of “display”.

            <p>
                Using modest materials that are vernacular and tactile, the
                exploration strives to develop a display system that is
                structural and adaptable in supporting the display of various
                physical and visual contents. Through this exploration, Studio
                Juju will demonstrate the robust process and re-interpretations
                of DISPLAY, both as a sculptural object and a functional
                concept.

                The exhibition system developed is applied to three exhibitions
                in the BBB Design District: DESIGN at the National Design
                Centre, HEAL at 42 Waterloo, and PLANT at the National Library.
