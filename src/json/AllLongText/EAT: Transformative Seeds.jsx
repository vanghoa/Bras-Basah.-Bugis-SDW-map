                EAT: Transformative Seeds is a food design exhibition that
                revolves around the seeds as a central theme. It explores three
                main areas: culinary transformation and consumption, the
                propagation and migration of seeds, and the innovative use of
                food materials.

                POP POWER showcases the simplest and oldest methods of creative
                transformation with seeds. As a representative starting point,
                the first part of the exhibition highlights cultural
                significance from the perspectives of taste, sound, and tool
                design through interactive experiences, products, and kinetic
                installations.

                SEEDING BEYOND captures the fervor of designers as they venture
                into the realm of food materials. Inspired by ancient cooking
                techniques, they redefine food's purpose, transforming it into
                practical objects. This innovative approach, seen through a
                laboratory lens, expands food usage beyond nourishment, creating
                everyday items with a touch of ingenuity.
