                Design is more commonly associated with planning and production,
                emphasising purposefulness, usability, and beauty. Its
                significant role, however, is still to drive shopping and
                consumption â€” to make things for sale and to make things sell,
                thus playing a crucial role in enabling mass production and
                consumption since the Industrial Revolution.

                The three-part exhibition SHOP explores the intricate dynamics
                between design and shopping, pushing our understanding beyond
                familiar notions of this relationship through a series of
                experiences. Given how much of design already propels
                consumption, can we use it to slow it down, change directions,
                or even reverse it?

                In a playful manner, all three exhibition segments are disguised
                as shops. The first provides a shop experience without any goods
                or services. The second challenges the notion of value, effort,
                and the use of readymades in products. The third features goods
                that cannot be purchased, encouraging viewers to rethink the
                concept of shopping through window shopping.

                Together, these shop-exhibitions bring to attention both the
                observable and subtle behaviours, practices, and environments
                associated with shopping. This culminates in an open-ended
                exploration where shops, shopping, and shoppers themselves
                become subjects of continuous design and redesign.
