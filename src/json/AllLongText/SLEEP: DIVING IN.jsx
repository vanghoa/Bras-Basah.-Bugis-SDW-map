                SLEEP: DIVING IN explores the elements of ideal sleep hygiene
                rituals to overcome the increasingly ubiquitous primary insomnia
                that many urban dwellers struggle with. Through an overnight
                stay with self-guided instructions, the participant deep-dives
                into a journey that mediates sleep hormones through various
                activities within the hotel room and its grounds in an embrace
                of sleep. Disrupted circadian rhythms begin to reset with a
                holistic biopsychosocial approach.
