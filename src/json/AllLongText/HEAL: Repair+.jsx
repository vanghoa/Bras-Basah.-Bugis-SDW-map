                What does "retail therapy" do for us? And yet, why are there
                some things that we keep even after they have lost their form
                and function?
            </p>
            <p>
                As throwaway culture and mental health and wellbeing
                increasingly draw our attention, HEAL: Repair+ delves into
                narratives that linger in the brokenness, and whether these can
                be safely expressed through broken items, and in repair provide
                an alternative path to healing.

                An open call was made via social media and community partner
                outreach to submit broken, spoilt and faulty objects that were
                meaningful or precious. Eight objects were chosen and paired
                with eight designers who were invited to restore the submitted
                objects. Through discussion and collaboration between the owners
                and designers, they explored the memories associated with their
                objects and pushed the boundaries of creative restoration, to
                create new objects and new memories.

                HEAL: Repair+ takes collaboration in a new direction as it
                evolves from Hans Tan Studio's successful exhibitions of R for
                Repair (2021) that highlighted global waste with ingenuity to
                give broken and discarded items a new lease of life, and R for
                Repair: London x Singapore (2022) which added further elements
                of cultural exchange and connected humans from across the globe,
                at a time when we were still reeling from the fallout of COVID.
