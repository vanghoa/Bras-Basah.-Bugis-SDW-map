                The exhibition DESIGN explores the empowering nature of design
                by placing it directly in the hands of people from diverse walks
                of life. This experiment in the democratization of design
                demonstrates that design sensibilities can be accessible to all
                and beneficial across various contexts.

                Curated at the intersection of design pedagogy and practice, the
                exhibition features workshops developed and led by four
                designer-educators, each exploring a distinct theme: emerging
                tech, care, sustainability, and culture. These tracks, currently
                in progress, are led by:
