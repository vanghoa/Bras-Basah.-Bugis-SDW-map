        the enduring allure of this versatile material. Joining forces with metalsmiths such as

        Fabricated metal pieces often grace our lives in the form of stylish lifestyle items,
        captivating spatial installations and elegant furniture. Yet, the intricate work, dedication
        and artistry behind each creation often remain unseen and underappreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
        MAKE offers an array of works that not only showcase the diverse qualities of metal but also
        challenge the limits of what can be achieved with it. Committed to sustainable and
        responsible creation, the works also take a conscious approach to repurposing material
        offcuts, transforming waste into masterpieces.
