            <p>
                During Singapore Design Week 2024, ten showcases presented
                across the Bras Basah.Bugis Design District will creatively
                examine the rituals of daily life through the lens of design.
                Challenging the mundane, each showcase delves into a specific
                activity such as Eat, Sleep, Shop, Read, Heal, Make, Plant,
                Commute, Display and Design. Through new works and collaborative
                projects, visitors will discover imaginative design
                possibilities shaped to offer fresh perspectives on the world
                around us, inspiring new ways of thinking, seeing, and
                experiencing daily life.
